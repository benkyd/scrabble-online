    → WHY THE HELL ARE THEY CALLED USERS IN SOME PLACES AND PLAYERS IN OTHERS
    → Why in some places is it user.name and others user.username
    → Should lobbies persist once game starts?

☐ Bugfixes
    → If a user leaves their current game then makes a new one, it's corrupted  
    → If a user disconnects during a game, the game is irrevokably corrupted
        → Usually, if a player leaves, it's fine, but if the host leaves. The lobbby is destructed and the logic creates a new game on the spot and they're the only player
    → Sometimes it scores words wrong and it requires a restart
    → Sometimes it recognises words wrong and it requires a restart
    → Sometimes it doesnt pass the turn along and it requires a restart
